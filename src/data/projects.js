You need the dark in order to show the light. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p><p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Don't be bashful drop me a line. I like to beat the brush. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Let all these things just sort of happen. It's all a game of angles.</p>"
